      <h1>Top 5 resources at BCIT</h1>
	  <p>Here at BCIT, students, faculty and staff have access to a plethora of resources available to them at no cost! We encourage anyone to take advantage and seek help from our professional and confidential services. Students are able to find help for their courses at the Learning Commons located in the library as well as our career advising in counselling and students development workshops. Disability Resource Centre is also open 5 days a week for students seeking additional help in their studies. We advise students to inform themselves of their career opportunities. Students are welcomed to explore healthy lifestyles and visit the recreation centre.</p>
